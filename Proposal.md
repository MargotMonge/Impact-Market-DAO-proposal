# ** Impact Market DAO proposal **

## Title: 
PACT trading competition

## Short Description: 
The purpose of this proposal is to incentivize investors to trade higher volumes of the PACT token, increasing thus the token visibility and utility.

## Scope: 
The idea would be to implement a trading competition in volume, where for instance the 15 traders who traded the highest volume of the governance token in a fixed period of time let's say, a month, would be rewarded. 
The reward could be in the form of extra PACT tokens, or another token such as Celo stablecoins as well as non monetory rewards which could include exclusive access to online talks, being recognized on the DAO's website and Discord server, or having personalized support.
Such competition could help increase liquidity of the PACT token and possibly lead to a higher demand for the token.
